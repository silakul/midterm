# Introduction
Suicide statistics in Turkey may vary depending on certain factors. There are research and reports made by the Turkish Statistical Institute (TUIK) on this subject. According to TURKSTAT's 2019 "Cause of Death Statistics" report, a total of 3,755 people committed suicide in Turkey in 2019, of which 70.7% were male and 29.3% were female.

If we analyze this report by education level:

Suicide cases in primary school graduates and below: 31.7%
Suicide cases among secondary school graduates: 30.3%
Suicide cases among high school graduates: 22.5%
Suicide cases among university graduates: 7.5%

According to these data, suicide rates decrease as the level of education increases in Turkey. These statistics show that education plays an important role in people's psychological health.
